### In this project, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:
1.	Apply practical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques on any tabular dataset using Python.
2.	Produce data visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
3.	Identify and handle duplicate and missing data

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Initial Data Exploration
- __Task 2:__ Univariate Analysis
- __Task 3:__ Bivariate Analysis
- __Task 4:__ Dealing With Duplicate Rows and Missing Values
- __Task 5:__ Correlation Analysis
